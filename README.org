Fork from https://github.com/b1412/jfinal-ext

This version is based on the original 3.1.3 version. The original version is based on JFinal 1.9.
Since my project is based on JFinal 2.2 and the last update is quite long time ago, I fork the branch
and upgrade the JFinal. There should be no difference in usage. Please refer to below link for the usage.
